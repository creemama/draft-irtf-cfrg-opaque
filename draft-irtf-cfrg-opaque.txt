                  The OPAQUE Asymmetric PAKE Protocol
                     draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque-latest

Abstract

   This document describes the OPAQUE protocol, a secure asymmetric
   password-authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual
   authentication in a client-server setting without reliance on PKI and
   with security against pre-computation attacks upon server compromise.
   In addition, the protocol provides forward secrecy and the ability to
   hide the password from the server, even during password registration.
   This document specifies the core OPAQUE protocol, along with several
   instantiations in different authenticated key exchange protocols.

1.  Introduction

   Password authentication is the prevalent form of authentication in
   the web and in many other applications.  In the most common
   implementation, a user authenticates to a server by sending its user
   ID and password to the server over a TLS connection.  This makes the
   password vulnerable to server mishandling, including accidentally
   logging the password or storing it in cleartext in a database.
   Server compromise resulting in access to these plaintext passwords is
   not an uncommon security incident, even among security-conscious
   companies.  Moreover, plaintext password authentication over TLS is
   also vulnerable to TLS failures, including many forms of PKI attacks,
   certificate mishandling, termination outside the security perimeter,
   visibility to middle boxes, and more.

   Asymmetric (or augmented) Password Authenticated Key Exchange (aPAKE)
   protocols are designed to provide password authentication and
   mutually authenticated key exchange in a client-server setting
   without relying on PKI (except during user/password registration) and
   without disclosing passwords to servers or other entities other than
   the client machine.  A secure aPAKE should provide the best possible
   security for a password protocol.  Namely, it should only be open to
   inevitable attacks, such as online impersonation attempts with
   guessed user passwords and offline dictionary attacks upon the
   compromise of a server and leakage of its password file.  In the
   latter case, the attacker learns a mapping of a user's password under
   a one-way function and uses such a mapping to validate potential
   guesses for the password.  Crucially important is for the password
   protocol to use an unpredictable one-way mapping.  Otherwise, the
   attacker can pre-compute a deterministic list of mapped passwords
   leading to almost instantaneous leakage of passwords upon server
   compromise.

   Despite the existence of multiple designs for (PKI-free) aPAKE
   protocols, none of these protocols are secure against pre-computation
   attacks.  In particular, none of these protocols can use the standard
   technique against pre-computation that combines _secret_ random
   values ("salt") into the one-way password mappings.  Either these
   protocols do not use salt at all or, if they do, they transmit the
   salt from server to user in the clear, hence losing the secrecy of
   the salt and its defense against pre-computation.  Furthermore,
   transmitting the salt may require additional protocol messages.

   This document describes OPAQUE, a PKI-free secure aPAKE that is
   secure against pre-computation attacks and capable of using a secret
   salt.  OPAQUE provides forward secrecy (essential for protecting past
   communications in case of password leakage) and the ability to hide
   the password from the server - even during password registration.
   Furthermore, OPAQUE enjoys good performance and an array of
   additional features including the ability to increase the difficulty
   of offline dictionary attacks via iterated hashing or other hardening
   schemes, and offloading these operations to the client (that also
   helps against online guessing attacks); extensibility of the protocol
   to support storage and retrieval of user's secrets solely based on a
   password; and being amenable to a multi-server distributed
   implementation where offline dictionary attacks are not possible
   without breaking into a threshold of servers (such a distributed
   solution requires no change or awareness on the client side relative
   to a single-server implementation).

   OPAQUE is defined and proven as the composition of two
   functionalities: an Oblivious PRF (OPRF) and an authenticated key-
   exchange (AKE) protocol.  It can be seen as a "compiler" for
   transforming any suitable AKE protocol into a secure aPAKE protocol.
   (See Section 6 for requirements of the OPRF and AKE protocols.)  This
   document specifies OPAQUE instantiations based on a variety of AKE
   protocols, including HMQV [HMQV], 3DH [SIGNAL] and SIGMA [SIGMA].  In
   general, the modularity of OPAQUE's design makes it easy to integrate
   with additional AKE protocols, e.g., IKEv2, and with future ones such
   as those based on post-quantum techniques.

   Currently, the most widely deployed (PKI-free) aPAKE is SRP
   [RFC2945], which is vulnerable to pre-computation attacks, lacks a
   proof of security, and is less efficient relative to OPAQUE.
   Moreover, SRP requires a ring as it mixes addition and multiplication
   operations, and thus does not work over plain elliptic curves.
   OPAQUE is therefore a suitable replacement for applications that use
   SRP.

   This draft complies with the requirements for PAKE protocols set
   forth in [RFC8125].

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Notation

   The following terms are used throughout this document to describe the
   operations, roles, and behaviors of OPAQUE:

   *  Client (U): Entity which has knowledge of a password and wishes to
      authenticate.

   *  Server (S): Entity which authenticates clients using passwords.

   *  (skX, pkX): An AKE key pair used in role X; skX is the private key
      and pkX is the public key.  For example, (skU, pkU) refers to U's
      private and public key.

   *  kX: An OPRF private key used in role X.  For example, kU refers to
      U's private OPRF key.

   *  I2OSP and OS2IP: Convert a byte string to and from a non-negative
      integer as described in [RFC8017].  Note that these functions
      operate on byte strings in big-endian byte order.

   *  concat(x0, ..., xN): Concatenation of byte strings. "concat(0x01,
      0x0203, 0x040506) = 0x010203040506".

   *  random(n): Generate a random byte string of length "n" bytes.

   *  "xor(a,b)": XOR of byte strings; "xor(0xF0F0, 0x1234) = 0xE2C4".
      It is an error to call this function with two arguments of unequal
      length.

   *  "ct_equal(a, b)": Return "true" if "a" is equal to "b", and false
      otherwise.  This function is constant-time in the length of "a"
      and "b", which are assumed to be of equal length, irrespective of
      the values "a" or "b".

   Except if said otherwise, random choices in this specification refer
   to drawing with uniform distribution from a given set (i.e., "random"
   is short for "uniformly random").  Random choices can be replaced
   with fresh outputs from a cryptographically strong pseudorandom
   generator, according to the requirements in [RFC4086], or
   pseudorandom function.

   The name OPAQUE is a homonym of O-PAKE where O is for Oblivious (the
   name OPAKE was taken).

2.  Cryptographic Protocol and Algorithm Dependencies

   OPAQUE relies on the following protocols and primitives:

   *  Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF, [I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf]):

      -  Blind(x): Convert input "x" into an Element of the OPRF group,
         randomize it by some Scalar "r", producing "M", and output
         ("r", "M").

      -  Evaluate(k, M): Evaluate input element "M" using private key
         "k", yielding output element "Z".

      -  Unblind(r, Z): Remove random Scalar "r" from "Z", yielding
         output "N".

      -  Finalize(x, N, info): Compute the OPRF output using input "x",
         "N", and domain separation tag "info".

      -  Serialize(x): Encode the OPRF group element x as a fixed-length
         byte string "enc".  The size of "enc" is determined by the
         underlying OPRF group.  The type of a serialized OPRF group
         element is called SerializedElement.

      -  Deserialize(enc): Decode a byte string "enc" into an OPRF group
         element "x", or produce an error if "enc" is an invalid
         encoding.  This is the inverse of Serialize, i.e., "x =
         Deserialize(Serialize(x))".

   *  Cryptographic hash function:

      -  Hash(m): Compute the cryptographic hash of input message "m".
         The type of the hash is determined by the chosen OPRF group.

      -  Nh: The output size of the Hash function.

   *  Memory Hard Function (MHF):

      -  Harden(msg, params): Repeatedly apply a memory hard function
         with parameters "params" to strengthen the input "msg" against
         offline dictionary attacks.  This function also needs to
         satisfy collision resistance.

   Note that we only need the base mode variant (as opposed to the
   verifiable mode variant) of the OPRF described in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf].  We also assume the existence of a function
   "KeyGen" from [I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf], which generates an OPRF private
   and public key.  OPAQUE only requires an OPRF private key.  We write
   "(kU, _) = KeyGen()" to denote use of this function for generating
   secret key "kU" (and discarding the corresponding public key).

3.  Core Protocol

   OPAQUE consists of two stages: registration and authenticated key
   exchange.  In the first stage, a client registers its password with
   the server and stores its encrypted credentials on the server.  In
   the second stage, a client obtains those credentials, unlocks them
   using the user's password and subsequently uses them as input to an
   authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol.

   Both registration and authenticated key exchange stages require
   running an OPRF protocol.  The latter stage additionally requires
   running a mutually-authenticated key-exchange protocol (AKE) using
   credentials recovered after the OPRF protocol completes.  (The key-
   exchange protocol MUST satisfy forward secrecy and the KCI
   requirement discussed in Section 6.)

   We first define the core OPAQUE protocol based on a generic OPRF,
   hash, and MHF function.  Section 4 describes specific instantiations
   of OPAQUE using various AKE protocols, including: HMQV, 3DH, and
   SIGMA-I.  [I-D.sullivan-tls-opaque] discusses integration with TLS
   1.3 [RFC8446].

3.1.  Credential types and envelope construction

   OPAQUE makes use of a structure "Envelope" to store client
   credentials.  The "Envelope" structure embeds the following types of
   credentials:

   *  skU: The encoded user private key for the AKE protocol.

   *  pkS: The encoded server public key for the AKE protocol.

   *  idU: The user identity.  This is an application-specific value,
      e.g., an e-mail address or normal account name.

   *  idS: The server identity.  This is typically a domain name, e.g.,
      example.com.  See Section 3.5 for information about this identity.

   Each public and private key value is an opaque byte string, specific
   to the AKE protocol in which OPAQUE is instantiated.  For example, if
   used as raw public keys for TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], they may be RSA or
   ECDSA keys as per [RFC7250].

   These credentials are incorporated in the "SecretCredentials" and
   "CleartextCredentials" structs, depending on the mode set by the
   value of "EnvelopeMode":

   enum {
     base(1),
     customIdentifier(2),
     (255)
   } EnvelopeMode;

   The "base" mode defines "SecretCredentials" and
   "CleartextCredentials" as follows:

   struct {
     opaque skU<1..2^16-1>;
   } SecretCredentials;

   struct {
     opaque pkS<1..2^16-1>;
   } CleartextCredentials;

   The "customIdentifier" mode defines "SecretCredentials" and
   "CleartextCredentials" as follows:

   struct {
     opaque skU<1..2^16-1>;
   } SecretCredentials;

   struct {
     opaque pkS<1..2^16-1>;
     opaque idU<0..2^16-1>;
     opaque idS<0..2^16-1>;
   } CleartextCredentials;

   These credentials are embedded into the following "Envelope"
   structure with encryption and authentication.

   struct {
     InnerEnvelopeMode mode;
     opaque nonce[32];
     opaque ct<1..2^16-1>;
   } InnerEnvelope;

   struct {
     InnerEnvelope contents;
     opaque auth_tag[Nh];
   } Envelope;

   nonce  A unique 32-byte nonce used to protect this Envelope.

   ct  Encoding of encrypted and authenticated "SecretCredentials".

   auth_tag  Authentication tag protecting the contents of the envelope,
      covering "InnerEnvelope" and "CleartextCredentials".

   The full procedure for constructing "Envelope" and "InnerEnvelope"
   from "SecretCredentials" and "CleartextCredentials" is described in
   Section 3.2.2.3.

   The "EnvelopeMode" value is specified as part of the configuration
   (see Section 5).

3.2.  Offline registration stage

   Registration is executed between a user U (running on a client
   machine) and a server S.  It is assumed the server can identify the
   user and the client can authenticate the server during this
   registration phase.  This is the only part in OPAQUE that requires an
   authenticated channel, either physical, out-of-band, PKI-based, etc.
   This section describes the registration flow, message encoding, and
   helper functions.  Moreover, U has a key pair (skU, pkU) for an AKE
   protocol which is suitable for use with OPAQUE; See Section 3.3.
   (skU, pkU) may be randomly generated for the account or provided by
   the calling client.  Clients MUST NOT use the same key pair (skU,
   pkU) for two different accounts.

   To begin, U chooses password pwdU, and S chooses its own pair of
   private-public keys skS and pkS for use with the AKE.  S can use the
   same pair of keys with multiple users.  These steps can happen
   offline, i.e., before the registration phase.  Once complete, the
   registration process proceeds as follows:

         Client (pwdU, skU, pkU)                       Server (skS, pkS)
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
    request, blind = CreateRegistrationRequest(pwdU)

                                      request
                                 ----------------->

               (response, kU) = CreateRegistrationResponse(request, pkS)

                                      response
                                 <-----------------

    record = FinalizeRequest(pwdU, skU, blind, request, response)

                                       record
                                 ------------------>

                                                StoreUserRecord(record)

   Both client and server MUST validate the other party's public key
   before use.  See Section 6.5 for more details.

   [RFC5869].  The underlying hash function is that which is associated
   with the OPAQUE configuration (see Section 5).

   See Section 3.4 for details about the output export_key usage.

3.2.2.4.  StoreUserRecord

   The StoreUserRecord function stores the tuple "(envU, pkS, skS, pkU,
   kU)", where envU and pkU are obtained from the input
   RegistrationUpload message in a record associated with the user's
   account idU.  If "skS" and "pkS" are used for multiple users, the
   server can store these values separately and omit them from the
   user's record.

3.3.  Online authenticated key exchange stage

   After registration, the user (through a client machine) and server
   run the authenticated key exchange stage of the OPAQUE protocol.
   This stage is composed of a concurrent OPRF and key exchange flow.
   The key exchange protocol is authenticated using the client and
   server private keys established during the offline phase; see
   Section 3.2.  The type of keys MUST be suitable for the key exchange
   protocol.  For example, if the key exchange protocol is 3DH, as
   described in Section 4.2, then the private and public keys must be
   Diffie-Hellman keys.  At the end, the client proves the user's
   knowledge of the password, and both client and server agree on a
   mutually authenticated shared secret key.

   This section describes the message flow, encoding, and helper
   functions used in this stage.

       Client (pwdU)                       Server (skS, pkS, kU, envU, pkU)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
   request, blind = CreateCredentialRequest(pwdU)

                                   request
                              ----------------->

                response = CreateCredentialResponse(request, pkS, kU, envU, pkU)

                                   response
                              <-----------------

  creds, export_key = RecoverCredentials(pwdU, blind, request, response)

                               (AKE with creds)
                              <================>

   The protocol messages below do not include the AKE protocol.
   Instead, OPAQUE assumes the client and server run the AKE using the
   credentials recovered from the OPRF protocol.

   Note also that the authenticated key exchange stage can run the OPRF
   and AKE protocols concurrently with interleaved and combined messages
   (while preserving the internal ordering of messages in each
   protocol).  In all cases, the client needs to obtain envU and rwdU
   (i.e., complete the OPRF protocol) before it can use its own private
   key skU and the server's public key pkS in the AKE.  See Section 4
   for examples of this integration.

   [[RFC editor: please change "OPAQUE01" to the correct RFC identifier
   before publication.]]

3.4.  Export Key

   OPAQUE outputs an export_key that may be used for additional
   application-specific purposes.  For example, one might expand the use
   of OPAQUE with a credential-retrieval functionality that is separate
   from the contents of the "Envelope" structure.

   The exporter_key MUST NOT be used in any way before the HMAC value in
   the envelope is validated.  See Section 6.2 for more details about
   this requirement.

3.5.  AKE Execution and Party Identities

   The AKE protocol is run as part of the online authenticated key
   exchange flow described above.  The AKE MUST authenticate the OPAQUE
   transcript, which consists of the encoded "request" and "response"
   messages exchanged during the OPRF computation and credential fetch
   flow.

   Also, authenticated key-exchange protocols generate keys that need to
   be uniquely and verifiably bound to a pair of identities.  In the
   case of OPAQUE, those identities correspond to idU and idS.  Thus, it
   is essential for the parties to agree on such identities, including
   an agreed bit representation of these identities as needed.

   Applications may have different policies about how and when
   identities are determined.  A natural approach is to tie idU to the
   identity the server uses to fetch envU (hence determined during
   password registration) and to tie idS to the server identity used by
   the client to initiate an offline password registration or online
   authenticated key exchange session. idS and idU can also be part of
   envU or be tied to the parties' public keys.  In principle, it is
   possible that identities change across different sessions as long as
   there is a policy that can establish if the identity is acceptable or
   not to the peer.  However, we note that the public keys of both the
   server and the user must always be those defined at time of password
   registration.

4.  Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol Instantiations

   This section describes several instantiations of OPAQUE using
   different AKE protocols, all of which satisfy the forward secrecy and
   KCI properties discussed in Section 6.  For the sake of concreteness
   it only includes AKE protocols consisting of three messages, denoted
   KE1, KE2, KE3, where KE1 and KE2 include key exchange shares (DH
   values) sent by client and server, respectively, and KE3 provides
   explicit client authentication and full forward security (without it,
   forward secrecy is only achieved against eavesdroppers which is
   insufficient for OPAQUE security).

   As shown in [OPAQUE], OPAQUE cannot use less than three messages so
   the 3-message instantiations presented here are optimal in terms of
   number of messages.  On the other hand, there is no impediment of
   using OPAQUE with protocols with more than 3 messages as in the case
   of IKEv2 (or the underlying SIGMA-R protocol [SIGMA]).

   The generic outline of OPAQUE with a 3-message AKE protocol is as
   follows:

   *  C to S: credential_request, KE1

   *  S to C: credential_response, KE2

   *  C to S: KE3

   Key derivation and other details of the protocol are specified by the
   KE scheme.  We note that by the results in [OPAQUE], KE2 and KE3
   should authenticate credential_request and credential_response,
   respectively, for binding between the underlying OPRF protocol
   messages and the KE session.

   Next, we present three instantiations of OPAQUE - with HMQV, 3DH and
   SIGMA-I.  [I-D.sullivan-tls-opaque] discusses integration with TLS
   1.3 [RFC8446].  Note that these instantiations transmit idU in
   cleartext.  Applications that require idU privacy should encrypt this
   appropriately.  Mechanisms for doing so are outside the scope of this
   document, though may be addressed elsewhere, such as in
   [I-D.sullivan-tls-opaque].

   OPAQUE may be instantiated with any post-quantum (PQ) AKE protocol
   that has the message flow above and security properties (KCI
   resistance and forward secrecy) outlined in Section 6.  This document
   does not specify such an instantiation.  Note that such an
   instantiation is not quantum safe unless the OPRF and data encryption
   schemes are quantum safe.  However, an instantiation where both AKE
   and data encryption are quantum safe, but the OPRF is not, would
   still ensure data security against future quantum attacks since
   breaking the OPRF does not retroactively affect the security of data
   transferred over a quantum-safe secure channel.

4.1.  Key Schedule Utility Functions

   The key derivation procedures for HMQV, 3DH, and SIGMA-I
   instantiations all make use of the functions below, re-purposed from
   TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].

   HKDF-Expand-Label(Secret, Label, Context, Length) =
     HKDF-Expand(Secret, HkdfLabel, Length)

   Where HkdfLabel is specified as:

   struct {
      uint16 length = Length;
      opaque label<8..255> = "OPAQUE " + Label;
      opaque context<0..255> = Context;
   } HkdfLabel;

   Derive-Secret(Secret, Label, Transcript) =
       HKDF-Expand-Label(Secret, Label, Hash(Transcript), Nh)

   HKDF uses Hash as its underlying hash function, which is the same as
   that which is indicated by the OPAQUE instantiation.

4.2.  Instantiation with HMQV and 3DH

   The integration of OPAQUE with HMQV [HMQV] leads to the most
   efficient instantiation of OPAQUE in terms of exponentiations count.
   Performance is close to optimal due to the low cost of authentication
   in HMQV: Just 1/6 of an exponentiation for each party over the cost
   of a regular DH exchange.  However, HMQV is encumbered by an IBM
   patent, hence we also present OPAQUE with 3DH which only differs in
   the key derivation function at the cost of two additional
   exponentiations (and less resilience to the compromise of ephemeral
   exponents).  We note that 3DH serves as a basis for the key-exchange
   protocol of [SIGNAL].  Importantly, many other protocols follow a
   similar format with differences mainly in the key derivation
   function.  This includes the Noise family of protocols.  Extensions
   also apply to KEM-based AKE protocols as in many post-quantum
   candidates.

4.2.1.  HMQV and 3DH protocol messages

   HMQV and 3DH are both implemented using a suitable cyclic group of
   prime order p.  All operations in the key derivation steps in
   Section 4.2.2.1 and Section 4.2.2.2 are performed in this group and
   represented here using multiplicative notation.

   OPAQUE with HMQV and OPAQUE with 3DH comprises:

   *  KE1 = credential_request, nonceU, info1*, epkU

   *  KE2 = credential_response, nonceS, info2_, epkS, Einfo2_, MAC(Km2;
      transcript2),

   *  KE3 = info3_, Einfo3_, MAC(Km3; transcript3)}

   where:

   *  '*' denotes optional elements;

   *  The private and public keys of the parties in these examples are
      Diffie-Hellman keys, namely, pkU=g^skU and pkS=g^skS.

   *  credential_request and credential_response denote the online
      OPAQUE protocol messages (defined in Section 3.3) which carry the
      client and server OPRF values, respectively, as well as the
      envelope.

   *  nonceU, nonceS are fresh random nonces chosen by client and
      server, respectively;

   *  info1, info2, info3 denote optional application-specific
      information sent in the clear (e.g., they can include parameter
      negotiation, parameters for a hardening function, etc.);

   *  Einfo2, Einfo3 denotes optional application-specific information
      sent encrypted under keys Ke2, Ke3 defined below;

   *  epkU, epkS are Diffie-Hellman ephemeral public keys chosen by user
      and server, respectively, which MUST be validated to be in the
      correct group (see Section 6.5);

   *  transcript2 includes the concatenation of the values
      credential_request, nonceU, info1_, epkU, credential_response,
      nonceS, info2_, epkS, Einfo2*;

   *  transcript3 includes the concatenation of all elements in
      transcript2 followed by info3_, Einfo3_;

   Notes:

   *  The explicit concatenation of elements under transcript2 and
      transcript3 can be replaced with hashed values of these elements,
      or their combinations, using a collision-resistant hash (e.g., as
      in the transcript-hash of TLS 1.3 [RFC8446]).

   *  The inclusion of the values credential_request and
      credential_response under transcript2 is needed for binding the
      underlying OPRF execution to that of the AKE session.  On the
      other hand, including envU in transcript2 is not mandatory for
      security, though done as part of including credential_response.

4.2.2.  HMQV and 3DH key derivation

   The above protocol requires MAC keys Km2, Km3, and optional
   encryption keys Ke2, Ke3, as well as generating a session key SK
   which is the AKE output for protecting subsequent traffic (or for
   generating further key material).  Key derivation uses HKDF [RFC5869]
   with a combination of the parties static and ephemeral private-public
   key pairs and the parties' identities idU, idS.  See Section 3.5 for
   more information about these identities.

   HMQV and 3DH use the following key schedule for computing Km2, Km3,
   Ke2, Ke3, and SK:

  HKDF-Extract(salt=0, IKM)
      |
      +--> Derive-Secret(., "handshake secret", info) = handshake_secret
      |
      +--> Derive-Secret(., "session secret", info) = SK

   From "handshake_secret", Km2, Km3, Ke2, and Ke3 are computed as
   follows:

Km2 = HKDF-Expand-Label(handshake_secret, "server mac", "", Hash.length)
Km3 = HKDF-Expand-Label(handshake_secret, "client mac", "", Hash.length)
Ke2 = HKDF-Expand-Label(handshake_secret, "server enc", "", key_length)
Ke3 = HKDF-Expand-Label(handshake_secret, "client enc", "", key_length)

   "key_length" is the length of the key required for the AKE handshake
   encryption algorithm.

   Values "IKM" and "info" are defined for each instantiation in the
   following sections.

4.2.2.1.  HMQV key derivation

   The HKDF input parameter "info" is computed as follows:

   info = "HMQV keys" || I2OSP(len(nonceU), 2) || nonceU
                      || I2OSP(len(nonceS), 2) || nonceS
                      || I2OSP(len(idU), 2) || idU
                      || I2OSP(len(idS), 2) || idS

   Here, idU and idS are by default set to be equal to the idU and idS
   supplied as a credential for the envelope; however, if no such
   credential was supplied, then these values (indepedently) default to
   pkU and pkS instead.

   Also, note that if pkU is not contained in the envelope, then it must
   be computed from skU by the client.

   The input parameter "IKM" is "Khmqv", where "Khmqv" is computed by
   the client as follows:

   1. u' = (eskU + u\*skU) mod p
   2. Khmqv = (epkS \* pkS^s)^u'

   Hash is the same hash function used in the main OPAQUE protocol for
   key derivation.  Its output length must be at least the length of the
   group order p.

   Likewise, servers compute "Khmqv" as follows:

   1. s' = (eskS + s\*skS) mod p
   2. Khmqv = (epkU \* pkU^u)^s'

   In both cases, "u" is computed as follows:

   hashInput = I2OSP(len(epkU), 2) || epkU ||
               I2OSP(len(info), 2) || info ||
               I2OSP(len("client"), 2) || "client"
   u = Hash(hashInput) mod (len(p)-1)

   Likewise, "s" is computed as follows:

   hashInput = I2OSP(len(epkS), 2) || epkS ||
               I2OSP(len(info), 2) || info ||
               I2OSP(len("server"), 2) || "server"
   s = Hash(hashInput) mod (len(p)-1)

4.2.2.2.  3DH key derivation

   The HKDF input parameter "info" is computed as follows:

   info = "3DH keys" || I2OSP(len(nonceU), 2) || nonceU
                     || I2OSP(len(nonceS), 2) || nonceS
                     || I2OSP(len(idU), 2) || idU
                     || I2OSP(len(idS), 2) || idS

   idU and idS are set according to the same rules described in
   {#derive-hmqv}.

   The input parameter "IKM" is "K3dh", where "K3dh" is the
   concatenation of three DH values computed by the client as follows:

   K3dh = epkS^eskU || pkS^eskU || epkS^skU

   Likewise, "K3dh" is computed by the server as follows:

   K3dh = epkU^eskS || epkU^skS || pkU^eskS

4.3.  Instantiation with SIGMA-I

   We show the integration of OPAQUE with the 3-message SIGMA-I protocol
   [SIGMA].  This is an example of a signature-based protocol and also
   serves as a basis for integration of OPAQUE with TLS 1.3 as specified
   in [I-D.sullivan-tls-opaque].  This specification can be extended to
   the 4-message SIGMA-R protocol as used in IKEv2.

4.3.1.  SIGMA protocol messages

   OPAQUE with SIGMA-I comprises:

   *  KE1 = credential_request, nonceU, info1*, epkU

   *  KE2 = credential_response, nonceS, info2_, epkS, Einfo2_,
      Sign(skS; transcript2-), MAC(Km2; idS),

   *  KE3 = info3_, Einfo3_, Sign(skU; transcript3-), MAC(Km3; idU)}

   See explanation of fields in Section 4.2.1.  In addition, for the
   signed material, transcript2- is defined similarly to transcript2,
   however if transcript2 includes information that identifies the user,
   such information can be eliminated in transcript2- (this is advised
   if signing user's identification information by the server is deemed
   to have adverse privacy consequences).  Similarly, transcript3- is
   defined as transcript3 with server identification information removed
   if so desired.

4.3.2.  SIGMA key derivation

   The key schedule for computing Km2, Km3, Ke2, Ke3, and SK is the same
   as specified in Section 4.2.2.  The HKDF input parameter "info" is
   computed as follows:

   info = "SIGMA-I keys" || I2OSP(len(nonceU), 2) || nonceU
                         || I2OSP(len(nonceS), 2) || nonceS
                         || I2OSP(len(idU), 2) || idU
                         || I2OSP(len(idS), 2) || idS

   idU and idS are set according to the same rules described in
   {#derive-hmqv}.

   The input parameter "IKM" is "Ksigma", where "Ksigma" is computed by
   clients as "epkS^eskU" and by servers as "epkU^eskS".

5.  Configurations

   An OPAQUE configuration is a tuple (OPRF, Hash, MHF, AKE,
   EnvelopeMode).  The OPAQUE OPRF protocol is drawn from the "base
   mode" variant of [I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf].  The following OPRF
   ciphersuites supports are supported:

   *  OPRF(ristretto255, SHA-512)

   *  OPRF(decaf448, SHA-512)

   *  OPRF(P-256, SHA-256)

   *  OPRF(P-384, SHA-512)

   *  OPRF(P-521, SHA-512)

   The OPAQUE hash function is that which is associated with the OPRF
   variant.  For the variants specified here, only SHA-512 and SHA-256
   are supported.

   The OPAQUE MHFs include Argon2 [I-D.irtf-cfrg-argon2], scrypt
   [RFC7914], and PBKDF2 [RFC2898] with suitable parameter choices.
   These may be constant values or set at the time of password
   registration and stored at the server.  In the latter case, the
   server communicates these parameters to the client during login.

   The OPAQUE AKE protocols are those which are specified in Section 4.
   Future specifications (such as [I-D.sullivan-tls-opaque]) MAY
   introduce other AKE instantiations.

   The EnvelopeMode value is defined in Section 3.1.

   [[https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque/issues/60: Should we
   have a registry for configurations?]]

6.  Security Considerations

   OPAQUE is defined and proven as the composition of two
   functionalities: An Oblivious PRF (OPRF) and an authenticated key-
   exchange (AKE) protocol.  It can be seen as a "compiler" for
   transforming any AKE protocol (with KCI security and forward secrecy
   - see below) into a secure aPAKE protocol.  In OPAQUE, the user
   stores a secret private key at the server during password
   registration and retrieves this key each time it needs to
   authenticate to the server.  The OPRF security properties ensure that
   only the correct password can unlock the private key while at the
   same time avoiding potential offline guessing attacks.  This general
   composability property provides great flexibility and enables a
   variety of OPAQUE instantiations, from optimized performance to
   integration with TLS.  The latter aspect is of prime importance as
   the use of OPAQUE with TLS constitutes a major security improvement
   relative to the standard password-over-TLS practice.  At the same
   time, the combination with TLS builds OPAQUE as a fully functional
   secure communications protocol and can help provide privacy to
   account information sent by the user to the server prior to
   authentication.

   The KCI property required from AKE protocols for use with OPAQUE
   states that knowledge of a party's private key does not allow an
   attacker to impersonate others to that party.  This is an important
   security property achieved by most public-key based AKE protocols,
   including protocols that use signatures or public key encryption for
   authentication.  It is also a property of many implicitly
   authenticated protocols (e.g., HMQV) but not all of them.  We also
   note that key exchange protocols based on shared keys do not satisfy
   the KCI requirement, hence they are not considered in the OPAQUE
   setting.  We note that KCI is needed to ensure a crucial property of
   OPAQUE: even upon compromise of the server, the attacker cannot
   impersonate the user to the server without first running an
   exhaustive dictionary attack.  Another essential requirement from AKE
   protocols for use in OPAQUE is to provide forward secrecy (against
   active attackers).

6.1.  Related analysis

   Jarecki et al.  [OPAQUE] proved the security of OPAQUE in a strong
   aPAKE model that ensures security against pre-computation attacks and
   is formulated in the Universal Composability (UC) framework
   [Canetti01] under the random oracle model.  This assumes security of
   the OPRF function and of the underlying key-exchange protocol.  In
   turn, the security of the OPRF protocol from [I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf] is
   proven in the random oracle model under the One-More Diffie-Hellman
   assumption [JKKX16].

   Very few aPAKE protocols have been proven formally, and those proven
   were analyzed in a weak security model that allows for pre-
   computation attacks (e.g., [GMR06]).  This is not just a formal
   issue: these protocols are actually vulnerable to such attacks.  This
   includes protocols that have recent analyses in the UC model such as
   AuCPace [AuCPace] and SPAKE2+ [SPAKE2plus].  We note that as shown in
   [OPAQUE], these protocols, and any aPAKE in the model from [GMR06],
   can be converted into an aPAKE secure against pre-computation attacks
   at the expense of an additional OPRF execution.

   OPAQUE's design builds on a line of work initiated in the seminal
   paper of Ford and Kaliski [FK00] and is based on the HPAKE protocol
   of Xavier Boyen [Boyen09] and the (1,1)-PPSS protocol from Jarecki et
   al.  [JKKX16].  None of these papers considered security against pre-
   computation attacks or presented a proof of aPAKE security (not even
   in a weak model).

6.2.  Envelope encryption

   The analysis of OPAQUE from [OPAQUE] requires the authenticated
   encryption scheme used to produce envU to have a special property
   called random key-robustness (or key-committing).  This specification
   enforces this property by utilizing encrypt-then-HMAC in the
   construction of envU.  There is no option to use another
   authenticated-encryption scheme with this specification.  (Deviating
   from the key-robustness requirement may open the protocol to attacks,
   e.g., [LGR20].)  We remark that export_key for authentication or
   encryption requires no special properties from the authentication or
   encryption schemes as long as export_key is used only after the EnvU
   is validated, i.e., after the HMAC in RecoverCredentials passes
   verification.

6.3.  Configuration choice

   Best practices regarding implementation of cryptographic schemes
   apply to OPAQUE.  Particular care needs to be given to the
   implementation of the OPRF regarding testing group membership and
   avoiding timing and other side channel leakage in the hash-to-curve
   mapping.  Drafts [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve] and
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf] have detailed instantiation and implementation
   guidance.

6.4.  Static Diffie-Hellman oracles

   While one can expect the practical security of the OPRF function
   (namely, the hardness of computing the function without knowing the
   key) to be in the order of computing discrete logarithms or solving
   Diffie-Hellman, Brown and Gallant [BG04] and Cheon [Cheon06] show an
   attack that slightly improves on generic attacks.  For the case that
   q-1 or q+1, where q is the order of the group G, has a t-bit divisor,
   they show an attack that calls the OPRF on 2^t chosen inputs and
   reduces security by t/2 bits, i.e., it can find the OPRF key in time
   2^{q/2-t/2} and 2^{q/2-t/2} memory.  For typical curves, the attack
   requires an infeasible number of calls and/or results in
   insignificant security loss (*).  Moreover, in the OPAQUE
   application, these attacks are completely impractical as the number
   of calls to the function translates to an equal number of failed
   authentication attempts by a _single_ user.  For example, one would
   need a billion impersonation attempts to reduce security by 15 bits
   and a trillion to reduce it by 20 bits - and most curves will not
   even allow for such attacks in the first place (note that this
   theoretical loss of security is with respect to computing discrete
   logarithms, not in reducing the password strength).

   (*) Some examples (courtesy of Dan Brown): For P-384, 2^90 calls
   reduce security from 192 to 147 bits; for NIST P-256 the options are
   6-bit reduction with 2153 OPRF calls, about 14 bit reduction with 187
   million calls and 20 bits with a trillion calls.  For Curve25519,
   attacks are completely infeasible (require over 2^100 calls) but its
   twist form allows an attack with 25759 calls that reduces security by
   7 bits and one with 117223 calls that reduces security by 8.4 bits.

6.5.  Input validation

   Both client and server MUST validate the other party's public key(s)
   used for the execution of OPAQUE.  This includes the keys shared
   during the offline registration phase, as well as any keys shared
   during the online key agreement phase.  The validation procedure
   varies depending on the type of key.  For example, for OPAQUE
   instantiations using 3DH with P-256, P-384, or P-521 as the
   underlying group, validation is as specified in Section 5.6.2.3.4 of
   [keyagreement].  This includes checking that the coordinates are in
   the correct range, that the point is on the curve, and that the point
   is not the point at infinity.  Additionally, validation MUST ensure
   the Diffie-Hellman shared secret is not the point at infinity.  For
   X25519 and X448, validation is as described in [RFC7748].  In
   particular, where applicable, endpoints MUST check whether the
   Diffie-Hellman shared secret is the all-zero value and abort if so.

6.6.  User authentication versus Authenticated Key Exchange

   OPAQUE provides PAKE (password-based authenticated key exchange)
   functionality in the client-server setting.  While in the case of
   user identification, wherein the focus is often on authentication, we
   stress that the key exchange element is essential.  Indeed, in most
   cases, user authentication enforces some policy, and the key exchange
   step is essential for binding this enforcement to the authentication
   step.  Skipping the key exchange part is analogous to carefully
   checking a visitor's credential at the door and then leaving the door
   open for others to enter freely.

6.7.  OPRF hardening

   Hardening the output of the OPRF greatly increases the cost of an
   offline attack upon the compromise of the password file at the
   server.  Applications SHOULD select parameters that balance cost and
   complexity.

6.8.  User and server identities

   The user identity (idU) and server identity (idS) are optional
   parameters which are left to the application to designate as monikers
   for the client and server.  If the application layer does not supply
   values for these parameters, then they will be omitted from the
   creation of the envelope during the registration stage.  Furthermore,
   they will be substituted with idU = pkU and idS = pkS during the
   authenticated key exchange stage.

   The advantage to supplying a custom idU and idS (instead of simply
   relying on a fallback to pkU and pkS) is that the client can then
   ensure that any mappings between idU and pkU (and idS and pkS) are
   protected by the authentication from the envelope.  Then, the client
   can verify that the idU and idS contained in its envelope matches the
   idU and idS supplied by the server.

   However, if this extra layer of verification is unnecessary for the
   application, then simply leaving idU and idS unspecified (and using
   pkU and pkS instead) is acceptable.

6.9.  User enumeration

   User enumeration refers to attacks where the attacker tries to learn
   whether a given user identity is registered with a server.
   Preventing such attack requires the server to act with unknown user
   identities in a way that is indistinguishable from its behavior with
   existing users.  Here we suggest a way to implement such defense,
   namely, a way for simulating the values beta and envU for non-
   existing users.  Note that if the same pair of user identity idU and
   value alpha is received twice by the server, the response needs to be
   the same in both cases (since this would be the case for real users).
   For protection against this attack, one would apply the encryption
   function in the construction of envU to all the key material in envU,
   namely, cleartext_credentials will be empty.  The server S will have
   two keys MK, MK' for a PRF f (this refers to a regular PRF such as
   HMAC or CMAC).  Upon receiving a pair of user identity idU and value
   alpha for a non-existing user idU, S computes kU=f(MK; idU) and
   kU'=f(MK'; idU) and responds with values beta=alpha^kU and envU,
   where the latter is computed as follows. rwdU is set to kU' and AEenv
   is set to the all-zero string (of the length of a regular envU
   plaintext).  Care needs to be taken to avoid side channel leakage
   (e.g., timing) from helping differentiate these operations from a
   regular server response.  The above requires changes to the server-
   side implementation but not to the protocol itself or the client
   side.

   There is one form of leakage that the above allows and whose
   prevention would require a change in OPAQUE.  Note that an attacker
   that tests a idU (and same alpha) twice and receives different
   responses can conclude that either the user registered with the
   service between these two activations or that the user was registered
   before but changed its password in between the activations (assuming
   the server changes kU at the time of a password change).  In any
   case, this indicates that idU is a registered user at the time of the
   second activation.  To conceal this information, S can implement the
   derivation of kU as kU=f(MK; idU) also for registered users.  Hiding
   changes in envU, however, requires a change in the protocol.  Instead
   of sending envU as is, S would send an encryption of envU under a key
   that the user derives from the OPRF result (similarly to rwdU) and
   that S stores during password registration.  During the authenticated
   key exchange stage, the user will derive this key from the OPRF
   result, will use it to decrypt envU, and continue with the regular
   protocol.  If S uses a randomized encryption, the encrypted envU will
   look each time as a fresh random string, hence S can simulate the
   encrypted envU also for non-existing users.

   Note that the first case above does not change the protocol so its
   implementation is a server's decision (the client side is not
   changed).  The second case, requires changes on the client side so it
   changes OPAQUE itself.

   [[https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque/issues/22: Should
   this variant be documented/standardized?]]

6.10.  Password salt and storage implications

   In OPAQUE, the OPRF key acts as the secret salt value that ensures
   the infeasibility of pre-computation attacks.  No extra salt value is
   needed.  Also, clients never disclose their password to the server,
   even during registration.  Note that a corrupted server can run an
   exhaustive offline dictionary attack to validate guesses for the
   user's password; this is inevitable in any aPAKE protocol.  (OPAQUE
   enables a defense against such offline dictionary attacks by
   distributing the server so that an offline attack is only possible if
   all - or a minimal number of - servers are compromised [OPAQUE].)

   Some applications may require learning the user's password for
   enforcing password rules.  Doing so invalidates this important
   security property of OPAQUE and is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Applications
   should move such checks to the client.  Note that limited checks at
   the server are possible to implement, e.g., detecting repeated
   passwords.
